## a) What is dankjisho.com?

Jisho is the Japanese word for "dictionary". Dank is the English word for "the very best" or "of the highest quality". By combining these words together the basic idea of *DankJisho* can be understood. The goal of DankJisho is to create an lightweight online Japanese-English/English-Japanese dictionary.

DankJisho will allow users to create personalized lists of words so that they may categorize them based on a common theme. The user will then be able to easily export these lists or words in to the open-source memorization app, Anki. User made lists can also be published for other users to use.

## D) Who will login into DankJisho?

All users will be able to create an account. However, an account is not required to use the basic search functionality of DankJisho. An account enables the user to create, publish, and export lists.
